# Current Mirror Design

## Overview
This repository contains the design, simulation, and analysis of a **Current Mirror** circuit. The project focuses on implementing a basic and improved current mirror used in analog VLSI design for biasing and current replication.

## Features
- **Schematic Design** using **Cadence Virtuoso**.
- **AC and DC Analysis** for performance evaluation.
- **Current Matching Characteristics** under different conditions.
- **Impact of process variations** on current stability.

## Design Methodology
1. **Schematic Design**: Implemented using **Cadence Virtuoso**.
2. **Simulation & Analysis**:
   - **DC Analysis**: Evaluates current matching and output compliance.
   - **AC Analysis**: Determines frequency response and small-signal characteristics.

## Tools Used
- **Cadence Virtuoso** for schematic design.
- **Cadence Spectre** for circuit simulations.
- **MATLAB/Python** for result visualization.

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
